# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical mobile experience issues in the chat application, specifically targeting typing lag and message update failures on small-screen devices (iPhone 12 mini and similar). The desktop version works perfectly, so the solution must preserve desktop functionality while dramatically improving mobile performance.

## Glossary

- **Chat Application**: The web-based real-time messaging system
- **Mobile Client**: Browser running on iOS or Android mobile devices with screen width < 768px
- **Desktop Client**: Browser running on desktop/laptop devices with screen width >= 768px
- **Quill Editor**: The rich text editor component used for message input
- **Pusher Connection**: WebSocket-based real-time message delivery system
- **Message Update**: The process of receiving and displaying new messages from other users
- **Input Lag**: Delay between user typing and character appearing on screen
- **Cookie Mode**: Authentication method using HTTP cookies instead of request body parameters

2. WHILE the mobile app is in the foreground, THE Chat Application SHALL maintain an active WebSocket connection to the Pusher service
3. IF the WebSocket connection drops, THEN THE Chat Application SHALL automatically reconnect within 5 seconds
4. WHEN the mobile device switches networks or wakes from sleep, THE Chat Application SHALL re-establish the Pusher connection
5. WHERE WebSocket connections fail repeatedly, THE Chat Application SHALL implement a fallback polling mechanism with 3-second intervals

### Requirement 3: Mobile-Specific Connection Handling

**User Story:** As a mobile user on an unstable network, I want reliable message delivery, so that I don't miss important conversations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing Pusher on iOS devices, THE Chat Application SHALL enforce WebSocket-only transport without XHR fallbacks
2. WHILE the Pusher connection state changes, THE Chat Application SHALL log diagnostic information for debugging
3. IF the connection enters a failed state, THEN THE Chat Application SHALL display a visual indicator to the user
4. WHEN the mobile browser tab becomes visible after being backgrounded, THE Chat Application SHALL verify and refresh the Pusher connection
5. WHERE connection errors occur, THE Chat Application SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with maximum 30-second intervals

### Requirement 4: Simplified Mobile Input Interface

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a streamlined input interface, so that I can focus on messaging without complexity

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE the device is mobile, THE Chat Application SHALL render a plain textarea input instead of the Quill rich text editor
2. WHEN a mobile user sends a message, THE Chat Application SHALL support basic text formatting through markdown syntax
3. WHILE typing on mobile, THE Chat Application SHALL disable autocorrect and autocapitalize to prevent keyboard interference
4. WHEN the mobile keyboard appears, THE Chat Application SHALL adjust the viewport to keep the input field visible
5. WHERE formatting is needed, THE Chat Application SHALL provide a minimal toolbar with only essential formatting options

### Requirement 5: Desktop Experience Preservation

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want to keep the current rich editing experience, so that my workflow is not disrupted

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE the device screen width is 768 pixels or greater, THE Chat Application SHALL render the full Quill editor with all formatting features
2. WHEN a desktop user interacts with the chat, THE Chat Application SHALL maintain all existing keyboard shortcuts and formatting options
3. WHILE desktop users send messages, THE Chat Application SHALL continue using the current request body authentication method
4. WHEN desktop users edit messages, THE Chat Application SHALL preserve all rich text formatting capabilities
5. WHERE desktop functionality exists, THE Chat Application SHALL NOT modify or remove any features

### Requirement 6: Responsive Detection and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user switching between devices, I want the app to automatically adapt, so that I get the best experience on each device

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chat Application loads, THE Chat Application SHALL detect the device type using screen width and user agent
2. WHILE the browser window is resized, THE Chat Application SHALL re-evaluate device type and switch components if crossing the 768px threshold
3. IF the device orientation changes, THEN THE Chat Application SHALL recalculate the appropriate input component
4. WHEN device type is detected as mobile, THE Chat Application SHALL set a global flag accessible to all components
5. WHERE device detection occurs, THE Chat Application SHALL store the result in component state to avoid repeated calculations

### Requirement 7: Message Synchronization Reliability

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want my sent messages to appear immediately, so that I know they were delivered

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile user sends a message, THE Chat Application SHALL display an optimistic UI update within 100 milliseconds
2. WHILE waiting for server confirmation, THE Chat Application SHALL mark the message with a temporary identifier
3. IF the server response includes the canonical message, THEN THE Chat Application SHALL replace the temporary message
4. WHEN the Pusher broadcast arrives, THE Chat Application SHALL deduplicate messages using both temporary and server identifiers
5. WHERE message sending fails, THE Chat Application SHALL remove the optimistic message and display an error notification

### Requirement 8: Mobile Network Resilience

**User Story:** As a mobile user on cellular networks, I want the app to handle poor connectivity gracefully, so that I can still use the chat

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests timeout after 10 seconds, THE Chat Application SHALL display a retry option to the user
2. WHILE the network is unavailable, THE Chat Application SHALL queue outgoing messages for later delivery
3. IF connectivity is restored, THEN THE Chat Application SHALL automatically send queued messages in order
4. WHEN the app detects offline status, THE Chat Application SHALL display a persistent offline indicator
5. WHERE the user attempts to send while offline, THE Chat Application SHALL inform them that the message will be sent when online

### Requirement 9: Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor mobile performance, so that I can identify and fix issues quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chat Application runs on mobile, THE Chat Application SHALL log connection state changes to the browser console
2. WHILE performance issues occur, THE Chat Application SHALL capture timing metrics for input lag and message delivery
3. IF errors occur in mobile-specific code paths, THEN THE Chat Application SHALL log detailed error information
